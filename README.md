## This project is about creating a function that, allows one to read a line ending with a newline character ('\n') from a file descriptor, without knowing its size beforehand. 


After this project, I understand how files are opened, read, and closed in an OS,
and how they are interpreted by a programming language for further analysis.
This task is crucial to understand for a future programmer since much of the time is based
on manipulating files for data management and persistence.
This project consists of coding a function that returns one line at a time from a text file.
